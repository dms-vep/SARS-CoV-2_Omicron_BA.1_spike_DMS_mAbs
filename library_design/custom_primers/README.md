# Custom primers

This folder contains primers that have been designed manually. Spreadsheets are in `col1:primer_name` `col2:primer_sequence` format.  
  
 `custom_primers.csv` spreadsheed  was appended to gisaid primer pool and contains primers with greater than one codon deletions.

 `custom_primers_NNS.csv` and `custom_primers_paired_NNS.csv` spreadsheeds have primers for receptor binding domain positions (`T376A`, `D405N`, and `R408S`) that are different between BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron lineages. They are appended to positive selection or paired positive selection oligo pools, respectively.
