## Comparison of deep mutational scanning measurements and natural SARS-CoV-2 evolution
These plots compare measurements from various deep mutational scanning (DMS) studies against the enrichment of mutations in natural evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 spike versus what is expected from the rates of observed mutations at four-fold synonymous sites.
The plots also show correlations among the various DMS datasets.

A higher correlation between the DMS measurements and the natural evolution enrichment will indicates better concordance between the measured phenotype and natural selection.

Each point on a plot is a different amino-acid mutation.
You can mouse over points for details on that mutation.

Note that many DMS datasets only examine a subset of amino-acid mutations at site, so different plots will contain different mutations.
Note also that enrichment during natural evolution is only calculated for mutations that have a reasonably high number of expected counts as otherwise there is too much noise.
